# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub MCP server from Smithery AI is experiencing timeout issues and connection problems when used in Kiro. Based on analysis of the server implementation and reported issues, we need to fix authentication, timeout handling, error management, and configuration issues to make the server reliable and functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want the GitHub MCP server to connect successfully without timeouts, so that I can use GitHub functionality reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub MCP server is configured in Kiro THEN it SHALL establish connection within 10 seconds
2. WHEN GitHub API calls are made THEN the server SHALL respond within 30 seconds or provide meaningful error messages
3. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the server SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the server SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the authentication issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper GitHub authentication configuration, so that I can access GitHub APIs with my personal access token.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the GitHub server THEN it SHALL accept GitHub Personal Access Token through environment variables
2. WHEN the token is invalid or expired THEN the server SHALL provide clear error messages
3. IF no token is provided THEN the server SHALL fail gracefully with helpful setup instructions
4. WHEN using the token THEN it SHALL properly authenticate with GitHub's REST API v4

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the server SHALL log detailed error information including status codes and response bodies
2. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the server SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully and inform the user
3. IF server startup fails THEN it SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the server SHALL distinguish between temporary and permanent failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all GitHub MCP tools to work correctly, so that I can perform repository management, search, and issue tracking tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using search tools THEN they SHALL return results within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN creating or updating repository content THEN operations SHALL complete successfully or provide clear failure reasons
3. IF API responses are malformed THEN the server SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the server SHALL respect GitHub's rate limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server to work reliably in Windows PowerShell environment, so that I can use it in my development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the server SHALL handle path separators and environment variables correctly
2. WHEN using cmd or PowerShell THEN the server SHALL start and run without shell-specific issues
3. IF there are Windows-specific networking issues THEN the server SHALL provide appropriate workarounds
4. WHEN using the Smithery CLI wrapper THEN it SHALL work correctly on Windows systems
