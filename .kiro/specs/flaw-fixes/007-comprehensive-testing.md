# Task Specification: Implement Comprehensive Testing

## Problem Statement
While there are some unit tests, there's no comprehensive integration testing to ensure all components work together correctly, especially the critical RAG pipeline.

## Requirements
1. End-to-end tests must verify the complete RAG pipeline
2. Integration tests should cover all service interactions
3. Edge cases should be tested thoroughly
4. Tests should run automatically in the development workflow

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Integration Tests
- Create integration tests for the RAG pipeline in `src-tauri/tests/`
- Test the complete flow from wiki scraping to response generation
- Verify that context is properly retrieved and used

### 2. Service Integration Tests
- Add tests for service interactions (OllamaManager, WikiService, EmbeddingService)
- Test error conditions and recovery mechanisms
- Verify data flow between services

### 3. Edge Case Testing
- Test with various types of wiki content
- Test with different query types and lengths
- Test error conditions in all services

### 4. Test Automation
- Add test commands to `package.json` for frontend tests
- Ensure `cargo test` runs all backend tests
- Add CI configuration to run tests automatically

## Success Criteria
- [ ] End-to-end tests verify the complete RAG pipeline
- [ ] Integration tests cover all service interactions
- [ ] Edge cases are tested thoroughly
- [ ] Tests run automatically in the development workflow
