# Task Specification: Fix Database Lock Issues

## Problem Statement
The vector database implementation has some handling for lock issues, but it's not robust. It tries to remove the entire database directory when encountering lock errors, which could result in data loss.

## Requirements
1. Database locking must be handled without data loss
2. The system should retry operations when encountering locks
3. Users should not experience data loss due to locking issues
4. Error messages should be informative about lock-related issues

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Improved Lock Handling
- Modify `src-tauri/src/services/vector_database.rs` to implement proper retry logic
- Add timeout mechanisms for database operations
- Implement queuing for database operations to prevent contention

### 2. Data Protection
- Remove the current approach of deleting the entire database directory
- Implement proper lock release mechanisms
- Add backup mechanisms for critical data

### 3. Retry Logic
- Add exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Limit retry attempts to prevent infinite loops
- Log retry attempts for debugging

### 4. User Experience
- Display appropriate messages when database is locked
- Show progress for retry attempts
- Provide options to cancel long-running retry sequences

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Database locking is handled without data loss
- [ ] System retries operations when encountering locks
- [ ] Users do not experience data loss due to locking issues
- [ ] Error messages are informative about lock-related issues
