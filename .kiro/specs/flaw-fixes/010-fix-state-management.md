# Task Specification: Fix State Management

## Problem Statement
The frontend and backend don't have a consistent approach to managing application state, which could lead to synchronization issues.

## Requirements
1. State management must be consistent between frontend and backend
2. State changes should be predictable and traceable
3. The system should handle state conflicts gracefully
4. State should persist appropriately between sessions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. State Synchronization
- Implement consistent state management patterns between frontend and backend
- Add mechanisms to synchronize state between frontend and backend
- Handle state conflicts gracefully

### 2. State Persistence
- Ensure appropriate state is persisted between sessions
- Implement proper loading of persisted state
- Add migration mechanisms for state changes

### 3. State Traceability
- Add logging for state changes
- Implement debugging tools for state inspection
- Add time-travel debugging capabilities

### 4. State Validation
- Validate state changes to prevent invalid states
- Implement rollback mechanisms for problematic state changes
- Add unit tests for state transitions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] State management is consistent between frontend and backend
- [ ] State changes are predictable and traceable
- [ ] System handles state conflicts gracefully
- [ ] State persists appropriately between sessions
