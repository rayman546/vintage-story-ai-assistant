# Task Specification: Complete Frontend Integration

## Problem Statement
The frontend has UI elements for system status and actions, but it doesn't fully integrate with all backend services. For instance, there's no progress indication for model downloads or wiki updates.

## Requirements
1. All long-running operations must show progress to the user
2. System status must be accurately reflected in the UI
3. User actions should provide immediate feedback
4. The UI should be responsive during backend operations

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Progress Indicators
- Add progress bars for model downloads in the frontend
- Implement progress tracking for wiki scraping operations
- Update UI components to show real-time progress information

### 2. Status Synchronization
- Improve communication between frontend and backend for status updates
- Implement polling or event-based updates for long-running operations
- Ensure UI accurately reflects backend state

### 3. User Feedback
- Add loading states for all user actions
- Implement success/error notifications for user actions
- Provide clear visual feedback for button interactions

### 4. Responsive UI
- Ensure UI remains responsive during backend operations
- Add cancel functionality for long-running operations where appropriate
- Implement proper loading skeletons for content areas

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Progress is shown for all long-running operations
- [ ] System status is accurately reflected in the UI
- [ ] User actions provide immediate feedback
- [ ] UI remains responsive during backend operations
