# Flaw Fixes Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for fixing the 10 critical flaws identified in the Vintage Story AI Assistant project.

## Overview

The following tasks have been created to address each of the identified flaws. Each task has its own specification document in the `.kiro/specs/flaw-fixes/` directory that provides detailed implementation guidance.

## Task List

1. **Incomplete RAG Implementation** - `001-incomplete-rag-implementation.md`
   - Integrate the RAG pipeline to enhance chat responses with contextual information

2. **Missing Embedding Model** - `002-missing-embedding-model.md`
   - Implement automatic installation and management of the required embedding model

3. **Improve Error Handling** - `003-improve-error-handling.md`
   - Add comprehensive error handling and user notifications throughout the application

4. **Complete Frontend Integration** - `004-complete-frontend-integration.md`
   - Fully integrate all backend services with the frontend UI with proper progress indicators

5. **Configuration Management** - `005-configuration-management.md`
   - Implement a complete configuration system that allows users to customize settings

6. **Fix Database Lock Issues** - `006-fix-database-lock-issues.md`
   - Improve database locking mechanisms to prevent data loss and improve reliability

7. **Comprehensive Testing** - `007-comprehensive-testing.md`
   - Implement end-to-end and integration tests for all critical components

8. **Remove Hardcoded Values** - `008-remove-hardcoded-values.md`
   - Make all configurable values truly configurable through settings

9. **Improve User Feedback** - `009-improve-user-feedback.md`
   - Add detailed progress tracking and status information for long operations

10. **Fix State Management** - `010-fix-state-management.md`
    - Implement consistent state management between frontend and backend

## Implementation Priority

The tasks should be implemented in the following priority order:

1. **Missing Embedding Model** (Blocks RAG functionality)
2. **Incomplete RAG Implementation** (Core feature)
3. **Improve Error Handling** (Affects user experience)
4. **Complete Frontend Integration** (User experience)
5. **Configuration Management** (User customization)
6. **Fix Database Lock Issues** (Data integrity)
7. **Improve User Feedback** (User experience)
8. **Fix State Management** (System reliability)
9. **Remove Hardcoded Values** (Flexibility)
10. **Comprehensive Testing** (Quality assurance)

## Success Criteria

Each task should be considered complete when:
- The implementation matches the specification
- All success criteria in the task specification are met
- The fix doesn't introduce new issues
- Existing functionality continues to work as expected
- Tests pass (where applicable)
