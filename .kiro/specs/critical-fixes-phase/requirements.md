# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical bugs and missing components in the Vintage Story AI Assistant that prevent the application from compiling, running, or functioning properly. The fixes are prioritized by severity and impact, focusing on establishing a stable foundation for the application to operate correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Compilation and Runtime Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to compile and run without critical errors, so that I can develop and test the application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the Tauri configuration SHALL include all required plugin configurations for fs, http, and shell access
2. WHEN npm scripts are executed THEN the package.json SHALL contain complete and functional script definitions
3. WHEN the frontend imports components THEN all required React components SHALL exist and be properly implemented
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL launch without compilation errors or missing dependency failures
5. IF any critical configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue

### Requirement 2: Essential Component Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI components to render correctly, so that I can interact with the application interface without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the MessageRenderer component SHALL properly display both user and AI messages with markdown support
2. WHEN accessing application settings THEN the Settings component SHALL provide controls for model selection, temperature, context chunks, and theme
3. WHEN viewing chat history THEN the ChatHistory component SHALL display previous sessions with options to create, delete, export, and import sessions
4. WHEN any component encounters an error THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing the entire application
5. IF a component receives invalid props THEN it SHALL display appropriate fallback content or error states

### Requirement 3: Backend Service Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the backend services to operate reliably without memory leaks or race conditions, so that the application remains stable during extended use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OllamaManager service is terminated THEN it SHALL properly clean up all child processes and resources
2. WHEN processing streaming responses THEN the system SHALL handle malformed JSON gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN downloading Ollama installer THEN the system SHALL verify download integrity before proceeding with installation
4. WHEN multiple concurrent requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without race conditions or data corruption
5. IF a service encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error appropriately and continue operating where possible

### Requirement 4: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my application settings to persist between sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure the application each time I use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from a persistent storage location
2. WHEN configuration settings are changed THEN they SHALL be automatically saved to persistent storage
3. WHEN no configuration file exists THEN the system SHALL create a default configuration file
4. WHEN configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default settings and notify the user
5. IF configuration data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL recover by creating a new default configuration

### Requirement 5: Type Safety and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety, so that I can develop with confidence and catch errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with chat messages THEN all message data SHALL conform to defined TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN handling API responses THEN all response types SHALL be properly typed and validated
3. WHEN React components receive props THEN all props SHALL have explicit type definitions
4. WHEN data flows between frontend and backend THEN type consistency SHALL be maintained across the boundary
5. IF type mismatches occur THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL catch them at build time

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and graceful error handling, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical stack traces
2. WHEN the application encounters an unexpected error THEN it SHALL provide recovery options such as reload or retry
3. WHEN input validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about what needs to be corrected
4. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the application SHALL continue to function in a degraded mode where possible
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing simplified messages to users

### Requirement 7: Development and Maintenance Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project structure and documentation, so that I can maintain and extend the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN all components SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and file organization
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the existing architecture SHALL support extension without major refactoring
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available at appropriate levels
4. WHEN testing the application THEN proper error boundaries SHALL prevent component failures from crashing the entire app
5. IF dependencies need updates THEN the project SHALL maintain compatibility between frontend and backend components
