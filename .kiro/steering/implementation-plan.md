# Vintage Story AI Assistant - Implementation Plan

**NOTE**: This steering file should be deleted once the implementation phases are complete.

## Current Status: ~55% Complete

The project has substantial existing implementation with sophisticated frontend and backend architecture. Focus is on verification, integration, and completing remaining features.

## 4-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Health Check & Verification (2-4 hours)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete before proceeding

#### Objectives:
- Verify project compiles and runs
- Identify specific gaps and issues
- Test basic frontend-backend communication
- Establish baseline functionality

#### Tasks:
1. **Compilation Test**
   ```bash
   # Frontend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Backend compilation
   cd src-tauri && cargo check
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - Document compilation errors
   - Test frontend loading
   - Verify backend command handlers exist
   - Check service implementations

4. **Integration Test**
   - Test Tauri invoke() calls from frontend
   - Verify data flow between components
   - Check error handling

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Project compiles without critical errors
- [ ] Application launches and displays UI
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] Clear understanding of remaining work

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (4-8 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Essential features

#### Objectives:
- Fix critical compilation issues
- Get basic chat functionality working
- Implement core backend services
- Establish Ollama integration

#### Tasks:
1. **Fix Compilation Issues**
   - Resolve dependency conflicts
   - Fix missing imports/exports
   - Correct configuration errors

2. **Backend Command Implementation**
   - `ensure_ollama_ready` - Ollama status and health check
   - `send_message` - Chat message processing
   - `get_wiki_status` - Wiki scraping status
   - `update_wiki_content` - Wiki update trigger

3. **Service Integration**
   - Test ollama_manager with real API calls
   - Verify chat_service message handling
   - Check vector_database operations
   - Test embedding_service functionality

4. **Basic Chat Flow**
   - User sends message → Backend processes → AI response
   - Error handling for failed requests
   - Loading states and user feedback

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Application runs without crashes
- [ ] Basic chat functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Ollama integration shows proper status
- [ ] System monitoring displays correctly

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (8-12 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Enhanced functionality

#### Objectives:
- Complete RAG pipeline implementation
- Add wiki scraping and processing
- Implement data persistence
- Enhanced user features

#### Tasks:
1. **Wiki Scraping Implementation**
   - MediaWiki API integration
   - Content extraction and cleaning
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Progress tracking for updates

2. **RAG Pipeline**
   - Text chunking and preprocessing
   - Embedding generation and storage
   - Vector similarity search
   - Context retrieval and ranking
   - Prompt construction with context

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Chat history storage and retrieval
   - User settings persistence
   - Wiki content caching
   - Vector database management

4. **Enhanced Features**
   - Chat session management
   - Export/import functionality
   - Advanced settings (temperature, context length)
   - Theme and UI preferences

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Wiki content can be scraped and updated
- [ ] RAG system provides contextual responses
- [ ] Chat history persists between sessions
- [ ] All frontend features fully functional

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: LOW - Quality improvements

#### Objectives:
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive error handling
- User experience improvements
- Final testing and validation

#### Tasks:
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Vector search optimization
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Response time improvements
   - Caching strategies

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error messages
   - Graceful degradation
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - User-friendly error display

3. **User Experience**
   - Loading state improvements
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Accessibility features
   - Responsive design refinements

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Cross-platform verification
   - Performance benchmarking
   - User acceptance testing

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Application performs well under normal usage
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] User experience is polished and intuitive
- [ ] Application ready for distribution

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Each Phase:
- Use sequential thinking to plan specific approach
- Review previous phase outcomes
- Adjust timeline based on discovered issues
- Document progress and blockers

### During Implementation:
- Test frequently and incrementally
- Focus on integration points first
- Maintain working state between changes
- Document any architectural decisions

### After Each Phase:
- Verify success criteria are met
- Update progress documentation
- Plan next phase based on current state
- Communicate status and next steps

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items:
- **Ollama Dependency**: Ensure Ollama is installed and accessible
- **Service Integration**: Test all frontend-backend communication paths
- **Performance**: Monitor memory usage with large models

### Contingency Plans:
- **Compilation Failures**: Have fallback implementations ready
- **Service Issues**: Isolate and fix individual services
- **Integration Problems**: Use mock services for testing

## Completion Criteria

### Project Complete When:
- [ ] All 4 phases successfully completed
- [ ] Application runs reliably on target platforms
- [ ] Core functionality (chat + RAG) works end-to-end
- [ ] User can install and use without technical knowledge
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect final state
